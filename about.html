      that the Internet of Things should be secure, private and simple. Yet all too often IoT developers are lacking in
      security experience and missing the tools they require. So with |pipe| weâ€™re offering them a complete security
      toolkit -
      an API/SDK - with device code, plus branding and technical support so they can just focus instead on building
      awesome
      connected products.
